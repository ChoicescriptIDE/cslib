*comment :::::: GAME variables ::::::
*comment nothing special about these!
*create rerolls 3
*create name ""
*create alignment ""
*create race ""

*comment :::::: CONFIG variables ::::::
*comment cslib requires just one variable: cslib_ret, which
*comment is used to store (and access) the results that are
*comment "returned" from calls to a routine.
*comment implicit_control_flow also needs to be enabled.
*create cslib_ret 0
*create implicit_control_flow true

*comment :::::: CONST variables ::::::
*comment a useful practice is to hold any values you might reuse,
*comment but that also won't change, in "CONSTANT" variables.
*comment There's no functionality for this in ChoiceScript, but you
*comment can add const_ as a reminder to yourself not to modify them!
*create const_invalid_chars " 0123456789!?Â£@%$&*^()[]{}|\/`~"

*comment :::::: ARRAY variables ::::::
*comment cslib supports ChoiceScript 'arrays'.
*comment However, as arrays aren't *really* arrays,
*comment you will need to help cslib out a bit. Whenever
*comment a cslib routine asks for an array, it will
*comment expect there to be both a '_count' and '_max' variable,
*comment denoting its current and max length respectively.
*create race_max 4
*create_array race 4 "Orc" "Human" "Elf" "Dwarf"

*create attr_max 6
*create_array attr 6 "strength" "charisma" "wisdom" "intelligence" "constitution" "dexterity"
*create_array attr_val 6 0
