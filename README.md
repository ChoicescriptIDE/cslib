# ChoiceScript Library
<small>v1.0.0</small>

The ChoiceScript Library (cslib) is a collection of common, re-usable routines (i.e. functions) for use in development of ChoiceScript games. It's an attempt to extend ChoiceScript's core functionalities using vanilla ChoiceScript only. It relies heavily on string parsing and string manipulation.

[ChoiceScript](https://github.com/dfabulich/choicescript) is a simple programming language created by Dan Fabulich to aid non-programmers to write and code interactive fiction text-based gamebooks in the style of [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure). The language is proprietary and governed by its own [license](https://github.com/dfabulich/choicescript/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

The idea is to provide a community built (and driven) collection of routines, so [contribute](#-contributing) with ideas, code or feedback!

**Create, Learn and Experiment!**

## Use It!

### Installation
- Copy the file to your game folder together with your scene files.

- Create a global variable called `cslib_ret` to hold return values.

```
__startup.txt__

*create cslib_ret 0
```

- That's it! :partying_face:

You can now call any of the routines described in the file. :muscle:

Routines that need to return a value will generally do so through the dedicated global variable: `cslib_ret`. So make sure to capture its value into another variable!

Note that some routines will need you to create more global variables, or follow a naming convention, make sure you read the documentation on the routine before using it.

Also, remember that ChoiceScript is by nature not performant, which is fine, given its primary purpose. This library aims to extend ChoiceScript's core functionality, but don't go too crazy with it. Okay? :sweat_smile:

Credits are not mandatory but very much appreciated. :pray:


## Examples:
### Lowercase

It is very common that mobile keyboards automatically enable uppercase for the first letter of a text input. So you asked your reader to insert a colour for the character's eyes and now, every time, it comes up like this? 

> He looks into your sweet **Brown** eyesâ€¦

*Oof!* :joy: What if you could be sure every letter is in lowercase?

```choicescript
*gosub_scene cslib_string lowercase eye_colour
*set eye_colour cslib_ret
```

### Highest Stat

Very often authors need to check which of the stats is the highest one, whether to display flavour text or decide which branch to follow in the story. Writing a loop in ChoiceScript is not trivial and some authors even prefer to write many lines of `*if` statements just to work around it. But what if you could check it in a single line of code?!

```
*gosub_scene cslib_number max strength dexterity constitution intelligence wisdom charisma
*goto {"flavour_text_" & cslib_ret}

--------------------------------

*label flavour_text_strength
...
```
